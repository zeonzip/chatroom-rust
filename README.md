# Chatroom
Server and Client, written in Rust.

## Goals (in order):
- [x] Add all essential packets
- [x] Server Logic
- [x] Client Logic
- [ ] Add RSA

## Note:
I wrote the server in a short time, and the client in around 2 days or less. I will come back to refactoring this soon, but please don't comment on quality of code, as I will come back and fix that later.
